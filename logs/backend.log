Muchos puertoriqueños y Dominicanos, así que nos sentimos como en casa. Todo fue muy cómodo y limpio. Los vecinos hicieron mucho ruido en las noches, pero no fue problema para nosotros.

The apartment is a 4th-floor walk up, well-maintained and exactly as advertised in the listing. The apartment has all the basic things--it's especially nice to have a kitchen and comfy sofa. There's no TV and wifi, but you probably don't need it anyway since you are here to see New York city! It is just a short 5-min walk from the subway station, so very convenient. Street noise is not a problem although you can hear the neighbors at times (the kids next door can be noisy). East Harlem is a bustling Latino neighborhood with many local eateries and shops. The food selection is supposed to be great (too bad we didn't get to try any). There is a grocery store right outside the building. There're always locals hanging out in front but we were never bothered. All and all, a good choice if you are looking to stay in this part of the city."},{"at":"2016-05-17T04:00:00.000Z","by":{"_id":"6294d815d4a26c96b0b03aa6","fullname":"Vlad","imgUrl":"https://robohash.org/61270769?set=set1","id":"61270769"},"txt":"Kevin was an excellent host.

The apartment is a 4th-floor walk up, well-maintained and exactly as advertised in the listing. The apartment has all the basic things--it's especially nice to have a kitchen and comfy sofa. There's no TV and wifi, but you probably don't need it anyway since you are here to see New York city! It is just a short 5-min walk from the subway station, so very convenient. Street noise is not a problem although you can hear the neighbors at times (the kids next door can be noisy). East Harlem is a bustling Latino neighborhood with many local eateries and shops. The food selection is supposed to be great (too bad we didn't get to try any). There is a grocery store right outside the building.

It was great to have all amenities available, and at such a reasonable price.The only thing I will mention is that if you do plan on sleeping in- it might not happen as they do have a newborn who you can sometimes hear in the morning if you are a light sleeper.\r\nOverall,  I would recommend you stay at Alex & Shailas airbnb!

We preferred heading up to broadway to catch our trains (Depending where we were going) only because it was much more pleasant on sunny days to be above grounds if we could. It was great to have all amenities available, and at such a reasonable price.The only thing I will mention is that if you do plan on sleeping in- it might not happen as they do have a newborn who you can sometimes hear in the morning if you are a light sleeper.\r\nOverall,  I would recommend you stay at Alex & Shailas airbnb!

Kevin responded quickly to my inquiry about booking his apartment. Once booked he was very easy to reach via phone or text if I needed to. His one bedroom apartment was very clean and nicely furnished. It is central to a lot of restaurants and neighborhood shopping should you need something and a couple blocks from the subway and buses. Kevin was a great host. He was there to greet me, show me around the apartment and tell me a bit about the area. He also has maps and booklets about what to visit while in New York City. There is wifi in the apartment which is great. Kevin checked in with me just to make sure everything was ok during my trip. I had a wonderful stay at his apartment and would book it again!

The listing description was accurate enough, with respect to the way the apartment looks. If you can't deal with noise at night, however, this might not be the place for you. The neighbors were surprisingly noisy in the wee hours of the night and virtually silent during the day.

Nos proveyó de un matress de aire para nuestra amiga que vino de M.A. y se quedó una noche con nosotros. El barrio nos pareció bien, no tuvimos ningún incidente. Muchos puertoriqueños y Dominicanos, así que nos sentimos como en casa. Todo fue muy cómodo y limpio. Los vecinos hicieron mucho ruido en las noches, pero no fue problema para nosotros. Una sugerencia sería poner un espejo de cuerpo completo en alguna parte del apartento. En resumen, el apartamento fue perfecto para nosotros, nos volveríamos a quedar y claro que lo recomendaría!

There's no TV and wifi, but you probably don't need it anyway since you are here to see New York city! It is just a short 5-min walk from the subway station, so very convenient. Street noise is not a problem although you can hear the neighbors at times (the kids next door can be noisy). East Harlem is a bustling Latino neighborhood with many local eateries and shops. The food selection is supposed to be great (too bad we didn't get to try any). There is a grocery store right outside the building.

Street noise is not a problem although you can hear the neighbors at times (the kids next door can be noisy). East Harlem is a bustling Latino neighborhood with many local eateries and shops.

Street noise is not a problem although you can hear the neighbors at times (the kids next door can be noisy). East Harlem is a bustling Latino neighborhood with many local eateries and shops.

The listing description was accurate enough, with respect to the way the apartment looks. If you can't deal with noise at night, however, this might not be the place for you. The neighbors were surprisingly noisy in the wee hours of the night and virtually silent during the day.

Nos proveyó de un matress de aire para nuestra amiga que vino de M.A. y se quedó una noche con nosotros. El barrio nos pareció bien, no tuvimos ningún incidente. Muchos puertoriqueños y Dominicanos, así que nos sentimos como en casa. Todo fue muy cómodo y limpio. Los vecinos hicieron mucho ruido en las noches, pero no fue problema para nosotros. Una sugerencia sería poner un espejo de cuerpo completo en alguna parte del apartento. En resumen, el apartamento fue perfecto para nosotros, nos volveríamos a quedar y claro que lo recomendaría!

The apartment is a 4th-floor walk up, well-maintained and exactly as advertised in the listing. The apartment has all the basic things--it's especially nice to have a kitchen and comfy sofa. There's no TV and wifi, but you probably don't need it anyway since you are here to see New York city! It is just a short 5-min walk from the subway station, so very convenient. Street noise is not a problem although you can hear the neighbors at times (the kids next door can be noisy). East Harlem is a bustling Latino neighborhood with many local eateries and shops. The food selection is supposed to be great (too bad we didn't get to try any). There is a grocery store right outside the building. There're always locals hanging out in front but we were never bothered.

There're always locals hanging out in front but we were never bothered. All and all, a good choice if you are looking to stay in this part of the city."},{"at":"2016-05-17T04:00:00.000Z","by":{"_id":"6294d815d4a26c96b0b03aa6","fullname":"Vlad","imgUrl":"https://robohash.org/61270769?set=set1","id":"61270769"},"txt":"Kevin was an excellent host.

Muchos puertoriqueños y Dominicanos, así que nos sentimos como en casa. Todo fue muy cómodo y limpio. Los vecinos hicieron mucho ruido en las noches, pero no fue problema para nosotros.

There's no TV and wifi, but you probably don't need it anyway since you are here to see New York city! It is just a short 5-min walk from the subway station, so very convenient. Street noise is not a problem although you can hear the neighbors at times (the kids next door can be noisy). East Harlem is a bustling Latino neighborhood with many local eateries and shops. The food selection is supposed to be great (too bad we didn't get to try any). There is a grocery store right outside the building.

Street noise is not a problem although you can hear the neighbors at times (the kids next door can be noisy). East Harlem is a bustling Latino neighborhood with many local eateries and shops.

Muchos puertoriqueños y Dominicanos, así que nos sentimos como en casa. Todo fue muy cómodo y limpio. Los vecinos hicieron mucho ruido en las noches, pero no fue problema para nosotros.

Street noise is not a problem although you can hear the neighbors at times (the kids next door can be noisy). East Harlem is a bustling Latino neighborhood with many local eateries and shops. The food selection is supposed to be great (too bad we didn't get to try any). There is a grocery store right outside the building.

Street noise is not a problem although you can hear the neighbors at times (the kids next door can be noisy). East Harlem is a bustling Latino neighborhood with many local eateries and shops. The food selection is supposed to be great (too bad we didn't get to try any). There is a grocery store right outside the building.

All the furniture and the kitchen appliances are new.\r\n\r\nThe location is perfect for visiting Brooklyn and Manhattan (only 15-20 to Brooklyn Bridge and South Manhattan or 25-30 min to Times Square in the underground).\r\n\r\nAlso, Alex gave us some good advices the first day for having all we needed in the neighbourhood. Don’t miss Saraghina’s brunch (10 minutes walking from the house)!

Some noise travels from Alex' apartment upstairs but it is only a little during the day.\r\nThe area is a bit out of the main hub of Williamsburg and Bushwick but everything is easily accessible with a short walk or the subway about 8 mins walk away.\r\nAlex left me a list of great stores, cafes and restaurants in the immediate area.  \r\nSome people may be concerned about the area at face value as it is a white minority but I felt safe at all times.

We would use our vehicle to drive to the subway station (there are two corresponding)  and park nearby to facilitate the to and from.  If you need quick access to the subway at all hours of the day and night this may not be the place for you.\n\nThe apt. is an excellent value  for the money (as per  many  manhattan locations offer around  the same nightly  $$ rate but have to share their apt ).\n\n\n\n"},{"at":"2013-09-07T04:00:00.000Z","by":{"_id":"6294d815d4a26c96b0b03fa2","fullname":"Javier","imgUrl":"https://robohash.org/7055720?set=set1","id":"7055720"},"txt":"We really had a wonderful time in NYC thanks to Alex’s house.

Some noise travels from Alex' apartment upstairs but it is only a little during the day.\r\nThe area is a bit out of the main hub of Williamsburg and Bushwick but everything is easily accessible with a short walk or the subway about 8 mins walk away.\r\nAlex left me a list of great stores, cafes and restaurants in the immediate area.  \r\nSome people may be concerned about the area at face value as it is a white minority but I felt safe at all times.

It was great to have all amenities available, and at such a reasonable price.The only thing I will mention is that if you do plan on sleeping in- it might not happen as they do have a newborn who you can sometimes hear in the morning if you are a light sleeper.\r\nOverall,  I would recommend you stay at Alex & Shailas airbnb!

It was a very cozy place to come back to after long days out exploring New York. The subways are very close. We preferred heading up to broadway to catch our trains (Depending where we were going) only because it was much more pleasant on sunny days to be above grounds if we could. It was great to have all amenities available, and at such a reasonable price.The only thing I will mention is that if you do plan on sleeping in- it might not happen as they do have a newborn who you can sometimes hear in the morning if you are a light sleeper.\r\nOverall,  I would recommend you stay at Alex & Shailas airbnb!

Muchos puertoriqueños y Dominicanos, así que nos sentimos como en casa. Todo fue muy cómodo y limpio. Los vecinos hicieron mucho ruido en las noches, pero no fue problema para nosotros.

Street noise is not a problem although you can hear the neighbors at times (the kids next door can be noisy). East Harlem is a bustling Latino neighborhood with many local eateries and shops. The food selection is supposed to be great (too bad we didn't get to try any). There is a grocery store right outside the building.

Lamentablemente, es difícil llevarse una imagen positiva después de que te roben. El día antes de nuestra partida encontramos la luna del coche rota, y todo lo que había de valor, sustraído. Es una práctica habitual, no fue una excepción. La consiguiente desesperación, al estar \"abandonados\" en otro país, sólo la conoce quien la padece. Además, no habíamos aparcado en una zona  conflictiva, sino en un barrio residencial, muy cerca del apartamento. \nLo verdaderamente problemático no es el robo en sí, sino el hecho, ante la perspectiva de un largo viaje para volver a casa, de no tener ayuda posible: que el seguro no responda, no tener internet en el teléfono, etcétera, hecho que probablemente constituya un incentivo para los ladrones, pues es obvio que actúan desde el rencor.\nSi Margarida dispone el aparcamiento trasero a la casa todo será más seguro. No le recomiendo a nadie dejar el coche en la calle.\nEs recomendable también, controlar los precios de las tarifas de datos, ya que la Wi-Fi que nos fue brindada solo funcionó el primer día, y se hace muy necesaria estando de viaje. \nPor otro lado, es difícil llegar a entender para un español (que tenemos fama de fiesteros y gritones) como es posible que en una zona residencial todas las noches se reúna gente en una plaza a beber y hablar hasta las cuatro o cinco de la mañana.

Lamentablemente, es difícil llevarse una imagen positiva después de que te roben. El día antes de nuestra partida encontramos la luna del coche rota, y todo lo que había de valor, sustraído. Es una práctica habitual, no fue una excepción. La consiguiente desesperación, al estar \"abandonados\" en otro país, sólo la conoce quien la padece. Además, no habíamos aparcado en una zona  conflictiva, sino en un barrio residencial, muy cerca del apartamento. \nLo verdaderamente problemático no es el robo en sí, sino el hecho, ante la perspectiva de un largo viaje para volver a casa, de no tener ayuda posible: que el seguro no responda, no tener internet en el teléfono, etcétera, hecho que probablemente constituya un incentivo para los ladrones, pues es obvio que actúan desde el rencor.\nSi Margarida dispone el aparcamiento trasero a la casa todo será más seguro. No le recomiendo a nadie dejar el coche en la calle.\nEs recomendable también, controlar los precios de las tarifas de datos, ya que la Wi-Fi que nos fue brindada solo funcionó el primer día, y se hace muy necesaria estando de viaje. \nPor otro lado, es difícil llegar a entender para un español (que tenemos fama de fiesteros y gritones) como es posible que en una zona residencial todas las noches se reúna gente en una plaza a beber y hablar hasta las cuatro o cinco de la mañana. El caso es que como la visita ha sido en agosto y el calor era insoportable, teníamos que tener las ventanas abiertas y era muy difícil dormir, pues la gente no tenía ninguna consideración ni civismo en este aspecto.\nEsto no pretende ser una crítica destructiva; quizá tuvimos mala suerte, y aunque creo que hay aspectos a mejorar, el apartamento es una  buena oportunidad para conocer la ciudad, sobre todo por su relación calidad-precio y porque Margarida responde siempre con una sonrisa. Aun teniendo en cuenta los aspectos señalados, estoy seguro de que con el tiempo el recuerdo será bueno."},{"at":"2016-08-12T04:00:00.000Z","by":{"_id":"6294d815d4a26c96b0b03d15","fullname":"Mélanie","imgUrl":"https://robohash.org/55254902?set=set1","id":"55254902"},"txt":"Un très bon accueil de la part de Margarida.

Lamentablemente, es difícil llevarse una imagen positiva después de que te roben. El día antes de nuestra partida encontramos la luna del coche rota, y todo lo que había de valor, sustraído. Es una práctica habitual, no fue una excepción. La consiguiente desesperación, al estar \"abandonados\" en otro país, sólo la conoce quien la padece. Además, no habíamos aparcado en una zona  conflictiva, sino en un barrio residencial, muy cerca del apartamento. \nLo verdaderamente problemático no es el robo en sí, sino el hecho, ante la perspectiva de un largo viaje para volver a casa, de no tener ayuda posible: que el seguro no responda, no tener internet en el teléfono, etcétera, hecho que probablemente constituya un incentivo para los ladrones, pues es obvio que actúan desde el rencor.\nSi Margarida dispone el aparcamiento trasero a la casa todo será más seguro. No le recomiendo a nadie dejar el coche en la calle.\nEs recomendable también, controlar los precios de las tarifas de datos, ya que la Wi-Fi que nos fue brindada solo funcionó el primer día, y se hace muy necesaria estando de viaje. \nPor otro lado, es difícil llegar a entender para un español (que tenemos fama de fiesteros y gritones) como es posible que en una zona residencial todas las noches se reúna gente en una plaza a beber y hablar hasta las cuatro o cinco de la mañana. El caso es que como la visita ha sido en agosto y el calor era insoportable, teníamos que tener las ventanas abiertas y era muy difícil dormir, pues la gente no tenía ninguna consideración ni civismo en este aspecto.\nEsto no pretende ser una crítica destructiva; quizá tuvimos mala suerte, y aunque creo que hay aspectos a mejorar, el apartamento es una  buena oportunidad para conocer la ciudad, sobre todo por su relación calidad-precio y porque Margarida responde siempre con una sonrisa. Aun teniendo en cuenta los aspectos señalados, estoy seguro de que con el tiempo el recuerdo será bueno."},{"at":"2016-08-12T04:00:00.000Z","by":{"_id":"6294d815d4a26c96b0b03d15","fullname":"Mélanie","imgUrl":"https://robohash.org/55254902?set=set1","id":"55254902"},"txt":"Un très bon accueil de la part de Margarida.

Lamentablemente, es difícil llevarse una imagen positiva después de que te roben. El día antes de nuestra partida encontramos la luna del coche rota, y todo lo que había de valor, sustraído. Es una práctica habitual, no fue una excepción. La consiguiente desesperación, al estar \"abandonados\" en otro país, sólo la conoce quien la padece. Además, no habíamos aparcado en una zona  conflictiva, sino en un barrio residencial, muy cerca del apartamento. \nLo verdaderamente problemático no es el robo en sí, sino el hecho, ante la perspectiva de un largo viaje para volver a casa, de no tener ayuda posible: que el seguro no responda, no tener internet en el teléfono, etcétera, hecho que probablemente constituya un incentivo para los ladrones, pues es obvio que actúan desde el rencor.\nSi Margarida dispone el aparcamiento trasero a la casa todo será más seguro. No le recomiendo a nadie dejar el coche en la calle.\nEs recomendable también, controlar los precios de las tarifas de datos, ya que la Wi-Fi que nos fue brindada solo funcionó el primer día, y se hace muy necesaria estando de viaje. \nPor otro lado, es difícil llegar a entender para un español (que tenemos fama de fiesteros y gritones) como es posible que en una zona residencial todas las noches se reúna gente en una plaza a beber y hablar hasta las cuatro o cinco de la mañana. El caso es que como la visita ha sido en agosto y el calor era insoportable, teníamos que tener las ventanas abiertas y era muy difícil dormir, pues la gente no tenía ninguna consideración ni civismo en este aspecto.\nEsto no pretende ser una crítica destructiva; quizá tuvimos mala suerte, y aunque creo que hay aspectos a mejorar, el apartamento es una  buena oportunidad para conocer la ciudad, sobre todo por su relación calidad-precio y porque Margarida responde siempre con una sonrisa. Aun teniendo en cuenta los aspectos señalados, estoy seguro de que con el tiempo el recuerdo será bueno."},{"at":"2016-08-12T04:00:00.000Z","by":{"_id":"6294d815d4a26c96b0b03d15","fullname":"Mélanie","imgUrl":"https://robohash.org/55254902?set=set1","id":"55254902"},"txt":"Un très bon accueil de la part de Margarida.

Walking from the subway after dark was a little daunting but we remained safe. We did catch a cab a few times from Manhattan as it was very late.

Some noise travels from Alex' apartment upstairs but it is only a little during the day.\r\nThe area is a bit out of the main hub of Williamsburg and Bushwick but everything is easily accessible with a short walk or the subway about 8 mins walk away.\r\nAlex left me a list of great stores, cafes and restaurants in the immediate area.  \r\nSome people may be concerned about the area at face value as it is a white minority but I felt safe at all times.  People seemed friendly.\r\n\r\n"},{"at":"2013-11-10T05:00:00.000Z","by":{"_id":"6294d815d4a26c96b0b04922","fullname":"Pamela","imgUrl":"https://robohash.org/8145538?set=set1","id":"8145538"},"txt":"Was an amazing stay, we charm your apartment and were very friendly.

It was great to have all amenities available, and at such a reasonable price.The only thing I will mention is that if you do plan on sleeping in- it might not happen as they do have a newborn who you can sometimes hear in the morning if you are a light sleeper.\r\nOverall,  I would recommend you stay at Alex & Shailas airbnb!

The apartment is very spacious and recently renovated so it looks amazing. The kitchen has everything you need with Alex and Shalia stocking it with a few basics. The neighbourhood is a little shabby, especially compared to the home we stayed in. We were told by some people in Manhattan that the neighbour of Bed-Stuy used to be very dangerous and just to be careful walking around at night. Walking from the subway after dark was a little daunting but we remained safe. We did catch a cab a few times from Manhattan as it was very late. Overall, it was a positive experience with Alex and Shalia being very helpful, even going out of their way to let us store our luggage at Shalia's work the day we were to fly out.

It was great to have all amenities available, and at such a reasonable price.The only thing I will mention is that if you do plan on sleeping in- it might not happen as they do have a newborn who you can sometimes hear in the morning if you are a light sleeper.\r\nOverall,  I would recommend you stay at Alex & Shailas airbnb!

Some noise travels from Alex' apartment upstairs but it is only a little during the day.\r\nThe area is a bit out of the main hub of Williamsburg and Bushwick but everything is easily accessible with a short walk or the subway about 8 mins walk away.\r\nAlex left me a list of great stores, cafes and restaurants in the immediate area.  \r\nSome people may be concerned about the area at face value as it is a white minority but I felt safe at all times.  People seemed friendly.\r\n\r\n"},{"at":"2013-11-10T05:00:00.000Z","by":{"_id":"6294d815d4a26c96b0b04922","fullname":"Pamela","imgUrl":"https://robohash.org/8145538?set=set1","id":"8145538"},"txt":"Was an amazing stay, we charm your apartment and were very friendly.

She is respectful of one's privacy but always ready to give support when asked upon. Be it in spoken or written form I always got my answers from her within no times. She also proofed to be very flexible in terms of arrival and departure times which I appreciated a great deal. If you are a fan of jazz music (like I am), make sure to double check ahead of time about her current concert dates so as not to miss your hostess on stage like I did (grumble ;-)).\n\nThe room I occupied was the smaller one of two that Isabel rents out. So if her flat is fully rented out there can be a maximum of 4 guests plus your hostess in the flat, which can cause some bathroom jam, especially during the hot and humid summer times, when the need for a cool shower is inherent to everyone's desire. \nMy room was as depicted. If you plan on using it for double occupancy, I recommend taking Isa's larger room (unless the two of you are very much in love and want to cuddle up close ;-)). Also, if you need a table for writing, ask for the larger room as well, which comes along with one.\nThe flat itself is absolutely enchanting and furnished with love and an artistic eye to details. It's location is a dream for touristic explorations with anything within walking distance. \nTherefore, I can easily recommend both Isabel and her flat to anyone wishing to immerge himself into the local customs and get a good doze of what it is like \"to live like a true Barcelonian\".  \n\nQuerida Isa, muchas gracias por tu hospedalid génial! Volveré a ciencia cierta!\nSaludos y besos\nLiliana"},{"at":"2016-08-10T04:00:00.000Z","by":{"_id":"6294d815d4a26c96b0b0480a","fullname":"Murat","imgUrl":"https://robohash.org/35246459?set=set1","id":"35246459"},"txt":"The apartment is very centrally located, in the heart of the gothic part of the city and a couple of blocks from the Placa de Catalunya which makes transportation and sightseeing very easy. It's a 20 minute walk from the beach which is a plus. It's located in a very old building on the top floor, so it is rather stuffy and warm in the apartment. The room overlooks a very narrow street/alley so it's rather dark and it's easy to hear the noise coming from the street and the neighboring apartments. There are a few other rooms in the house that are being rented out, so other people will be staying in the house which makes it a necessity to lock the room when you leave the apartment. \n\nIt's important to note that this place has a very strict check out time. On our last day, we had an evening flight but had to check out in the morning. When we asked if we could check out late, Isa told us to take our stuff to the train station and use the lockers there, but the train station does not have lockers. We ended up renting a locker  at a place called \"Barcelona lockers\". That, I would say changed all the plans for the last day. \n\n"},{"at":"2016-08-26T04:00:00.000Z","by":{"_id":"6294d815d4a26c96b0b04bdd","fullname":"Mina","imgUrl":"https://robohash.org/121053?set=set1","id":"121053"},"txt":"I was happy to experience Isabels home as described here. It was spacious, bright and original, with lovely colours and beautiful artwork surrounding me in every room. Isabel is a creative, sensitive and respectful person, with an open mind- yet she has the necessary boundaries that are required to organize an environment where so many different people are going to stay and hopefully enjoy. \nThe street itself is very lively, but the noises didn't bother me at all as i could easily block them out with earplugs. The location could not have been more sentral, still it's on \"the right side\" of the Rambla, where you can find more independent shops, restaurants, cafes and bars compared to the same leveled streets towards Raval. It is an old and very charming building, so if you want an minimalistic experience with cold, stainless steel and elevators this is not the place for you! And perhaps you are not the right person for this place either ;) I had to leave earlier due to illness, and was so sorry i couldn't stay throughout the whole month as planned.

We preferred heading up to broadway to catch our trains (Depending where we were going) only because it was much more pleasant on sunny days to be above grounds if we could. It was great to have all amenities available, and at such a reasonable price.The only thing I will mention is that if you do plan on sleeping in- it might not happen as they do have a newborn who you can sometimes hear in the morning if you are a light sleeper.\r\nOverall,  I would recommend you stay at Alex & Shailas airbnb!

She is respectful of one's privacy but always ready to give support when asked upon. Be it in spoken or written form I always got my answers from her within no times. She also proofed to be very flexible in terms of arrival and departure times which I appreciated a great deal. If you are a fan of jazz music (like I am), make sure to double check ahead of time about her current concert dates so as not to miss your hostess on stage like I did (grumble ;-)).\n\nThe room I occupied was the smaller one of two that Isabel rents out. So if her flat is fully rented out there can be a maximum of 4 guests plus your hostess in the flat, which can cause some bathroom jam, especially during the hot and humid summer times, when the need for a cool shower is inherent to everyone's desire. \nMy room was as depicted. If you plan on using it for double occupancy, I recommend taking Isa's larger room (unless the two of you are very much in love and want to cuddle up close ;-)). Also, if you need a table for writing, ask for the larger room as well, which comes along with one.\nThe flat itself is absolutely enchanting and furnished with love and an artistic eye to details. It's location is a dream for touristic explorations with anything within walking distance. \nTherefore, I can easily recommend both Isabel and her flat to anyone wishing to immerge himself into the local customs and get a good doze of what it is like \"to live like a true Barcelonian\".  \n\nQuerida Isa, muchas gracias por tu hospedalid génial!

It's a 20 minute walk from the beach which is a plus. It's located in a very old building on the top floor, so it is rather stuffy and warm in the apartment. The room overlooks a very narrow street/alley so it's rather dark and it's easy to hear the noise coming from the street and the neighboring apartments. There are a few other rooms in the house that are being rented out, so other people will be staying in the house which makes it a necessity to lock the room when you leave the apartment. \n\nIt's important to note that this place has a very strict check out time. On our last day, we had an evening flight but had to check out in the morning. When we asked if we could check out late, Isa told us to take our stuff to the train station and use the lockers there, but the train station does not have lockers. We ended up renting a locker  at a place called \"Barcelona lockers\". That, I would say changed all the plans for the last day. \n\n"},{"at":"2016-08-26T04:00:00.000Z","by":{"_id":"6294d815d4a26c96b0b04bdd","fullname":"Mina","imgUrl":"https://robohash.org/121053?set=set1","id":"121053"},"txt":"I was happy to experience Isabels home as described here. It was spacious, bright and original, with lovely colours and beautiful artwork surrounding me in every room. Isabel is a creative, sensitive and respectful person, with an open mind- yet she has the necessary boundaries that are required to organize an environment where so many different people are going to stay and hopefully enjoy. \nThe street itself is very lively, but the noises didn't bother me at all as i could easily block them out with earplugs. The location could not have been more sentral, still it's on \"the right side\" of the Rambla, where you can find more independent shops, restaurants, cafes and bars compared to the same leveled streets towards Raval. It is an old and very charming building, so if you want an minimalistic experience with cold, stainless steel and elevators this is not the place for you! And perhaps you are not the right person for this place either ;) I had to leave earlier due to illness, and was so sorry i couldn't stay throughout the whole month as planned.

She is respectful of one's privacy but always ready to give support when asked upon. Be it in spoken or written form I always got my answers from her within no times. She also proofed to be very flexible in terms of arrival and departure times which I appreciated a great deal. If you are a fan of jazz music (like I am), make sure to double check ahead of time about her current concert dates so as not to miss your hostess on stage like I did (grumble ;-)).\n\nThe room I occupied was the smaller one of two that Isabel rents out. So if her flat is fully rented out there can be a maximum of 4 guests plus your hostess in the flat, which can cause some bathroom jam, especially during the hot and humid summer times, when the need for a cool shower is inherent to everyone's desire. \nMy room was as depicted. If you plan on using it for double occupancy, I recommend taking Isa's larger room (unless the two of you are very much in love and want to cuddle up close ;-)). Also, if you need a table for writing, ask for the larger room as well, which comes along with one.\nThe flat itself is absolutely enchanting and furnished with love and an artistic eye to details. It's location is a dream for touristic explorations with anything within walking distance. \nTherefore, I can easily recommend both Isabel and her flat to anyone wishing to immerge himself into the local customs and get a good doze of what it is like \"to live like a true Barcelonian\".  \n\nQuerida Isa, muchas gracias por tu hospedalid génial! Volveré a ciencia cierta!\nSaludos y besos\nLiliana"},{"at":"2016-08-10T04:00:00.000Z","by":{"_id":"6294d815d4a26c96b0b0480a","fullname":"Murat","imgUrl":"https://robohash.org/35246459?set=set1","id":"35246459"},"txt":"The apartment is very centrally located, in the heart of the gothic part of the city and a couple of blocks from the Placa de Catalunya which makes transportation and sightseeing very easy. It's a 20 minute walk from the beach which is a plus. It's located in a very old building on the top floor, so it is rather stuffy and warm in the apartment. The room overlooks a very narrow street/alley so it's rather dark and it's easy to hear the noise coming from the street and the neighboring apartments. There are a few other rooms in the house that are being rented out, so other people will be staying in the house which makes it a necessity to lock the room when you leave the apartment. \n\nIt's important to note that this place has a very strict check out time. On our last day, we had an evening flight but had to check out in the morning. When we asked if we could check out late, Isa told us to take our stuff to the train station and use the lockers there, but the train station does not have lockers. We ended up renting a locker  at a place called \"Barcelona lockers\". That, I would say changed all the plans for the last day. \n\n"},{"at":"2016-08-26T04:00:00.000Z","by":{"_id":"6294d815d4a26c96b0b04bdd","fullname":"Mina","imgUrl":"https://robohash.org/121053?set=set1","id":"121053"},"txt":"I was happy to experience Isabels home as described here. It was spacious, bright and original, with lovely colours and beautiful artwork surrounding me in every room. Isabel is a creative, sensitive and respectful person, with an open mind- yet she has the necessary boundaries that are required to organize an environment where so many different people are going to stay and hopefully enjoy. \nThe street itself is very lively, but the noises didn't bother me at all as i could easily block them out with earplugs. The location could not have been more sentral, still it's on \"the right side\" of the Rambla, where you can find more independent shops, restaurants, cafes and bars compared to the same leveled streets towards Raval. It is an old and very charming building, so if you want an minimalistic experience with cold, stainless steel and elevators this is not the place for you! And perhaps you are not the right person for this place either ;) I had to leave earlier due to illness, and was so sorry i couldn't stay throughout the whole month as planned.

She met me at the local bar where she worked and took me to her home a street away. The flight of stairs up to here place was a bit daunting but I can see why she lives up there.. It was beautiful! The room and whole place was clean, tidy and very welcoming. I saw Isabel twice, when I arrived and when I left, but it was perfect. \n\nThe facilities were great. The pressure in the shower was weak but it didn't bother me one bit. It is a bit noisy being in the heart of the city, but I can imagine it would be anywhere in this area. It was lovely to have a balcony, and the location was very convenient. Thanks.x"},{"at":"2016-06-28T04:00:00.000Z","by":{"_id":"6294d815d4a26c96b0b03fd8","fullname":"Monika","imgUrl":"https://robohash.org/11966400?set=set1","id":"11966400"},"txt":"Isabel was good host.

She is respectful of one's privacy but always ready to give support when asked upon. Be it in spoken or written form I always got my answers from her within no times. She also proofed to be very flexible in terms of arrival and departure times which I appreciated a great deal. If you are a fan of jazz music (like I am), make sure to double check ahead of time about her current concert dates so as not to miss your hostess on stage like I did (grumble ;-)).\n\nThe room I occupied was the smaller one of two that Isabel rents out. So if her flat is fully rented out there can be a maximum of 4 guests plus your hostess in the flat, which can cause some bathroom jam, especially during the hot and humid summer times, when the need for a cool shower is inherent to everyone's desire. \nMy room was as depicted. If you plan on using it for double occupancy, I recommend taking Isa's larger room (unless the two of you are very much in love and want to cuddle up close ;-)). Also, if you need a table for writing, ask for the larger room as well, which comes along with one.\nThe flat itself is absolutely enchanting and furnished with love and an artistic eye to details. It's location is a dream for touristic explorations with anything within walking distance. \nTherefore, I can easily recommend both Isabel and her flat to anyone wishing to immerge himself into the local customs and get a good doze of what it is like \"to live like a true Barcelonian\".  \n\nQuerida Isa, muchas gracias por tu hospedalid génial! Volveré a ciencia cierta!\nSaludos y besos\nLiliana"},{"at":"2016-08-10T04:00:00.000Z","by":{"_id":"6294d815d4a26c96b0b0480a","fullname":"Murat","imgUrl":"https://robohash.org/35246459?set=set1","id":"35246459"},"txt":"The apartment is very centrally located, in the heart of the gothic part of the city and a couple of blocks from the Placa de Catalunya which makes transportation and sightseeing very easy. It's a 20 minute walk from the beach which is a plus. It's located in a very old building on the top floor, so it is rather stuffy and warm in the apartment. The room overlooks a very narrow street/alley so it's rather dark and it's easy to hear the noise coming from the street and the neighboring apartments. There are a few other rooms in the house that are being rented out, so other people will be staying in the house which makes it a necessity to lock the room when you leave the apartment. \n\nIt's important to note that this place has a very strict check out time. On our last day, we had an evening flight but had to check out in the morning. When we asked if we could check out late, Isa told us to take our stuff to the train station and use the lockers there, but the train station does not have lockers. We ended up renting a locker  at a place called \"Barcelona lockers\". That, I would say changed all the plans for the last day. \n\n"},{"at":"2016-08-26T04:00:00.000Z","by":{"_id":"6294d815d4a26c96b0b04bdd","fullname":"Mina","imgUrl":"https://robohash.org/121053?set=set1","id":"121053"},"txt":"I was happy to experience Isabels home as described here. It was spacious, bright and original, with lovely colours and beautiful artwork surrounding me in every room. Isabel is a creative, sensitive and respectful person, with an open mind- yet she has the necessary boundaries that are required to organize an environment where so many different people are going to stay and hopefully enjoy. \nThe street itself is very lively, but the noises didn't bother me at all as i could easily block them out with earplugs. The location could not have been more sentral, still it's on \"the right side\" of the Rambla, where you can find more independent shops, restaurants, cafes and bars compared to the same leveled streets towards Raval. It is an old and very charming building, so if you want an minimalistic experience with cold, stainless steel and elevators this is not the place for you! And perhaps you are not the right person for this place either ;) I had to leave earlier due to illness, and was so sorry i couldn't stay throughout the whole month as planned. Hope to be seeing Isabel and her welcoming surroundings again one day "},{"at":"2016-09-07T04:00:00.000Z","by":{"_id":"6294d815d4a26c96b0b04788","fullname":"Jessy","imgUrl":"https://robohash.org/2935800?set=set1","id":"2935800"},"txt":"Isabel was an amazing host.

She is respectful of one's privacy but always ready to give support when asked upon. Be it in spoken or written form I always got my answers from her within no times. She also proofed to be very flexible in terms of arrival and departure times which I appreciated a great deal. If you are a fan of jazz music (like I am), make sure to double check ahead of time about her current concert dates so as not to miss your hostess on stage like I did (grumble ;-)).\n\nThe room I occupied was the smaller one of two that Isabel rents out. So if her flat is fully rented out there can be a maximum of 4 guests plus your hostess in the flat, which can cause some bathroom jam, especially during the hot and humid summer times, when the need for a cool shower is inherent to everyone's desire. \nMy room was as depicted. If you plan on using it for double occupancy, I recommend taking Isa's larger room (unless the two of you are very much in love and want to cuddle up close ;-)). Also, if you need a table for writing, ask for the larger room as well, which comes along with one.\nThe flat itself is absolutely enchanting and furnished with love and an artistic eye to details. It's location is a dream for touristic explorations with anything within walking distance. \nTherefore, I can easily recommend both Isabel and her flat to anyone wishing to immerge himself into the local customs and get a good doze of what it is like \"to live like a true Barcelonian\".  \n\nQuerida Isa, muchas gracias por tu hospedalid génial!

It's a 20 minute walk from the beach which is a plus. It's located in a very old building on the top floor, so it is rather stuffy and warm in the apartment. The room overlooks a very narrow street/alley so it's rather dark and it's easy to hear the noise coming from the street and the neighboring apartments. There are a few other rooms in the house that are being rented out, so other people will be staying in the house which makes it a necessity to lock the room when you leave the apartment. \n\nIt's important to note that this place has a very strict check out time. On our last day, we had an evening flight but had to check out in the morning. When we asked if we could check out late, Isa told us to take our stuff to the train station and use the lockers there, but the train station does not have lockers. We ended up renting a locker  at a place called \"Barcelona lockers\".

Isabel is a creative, sensitive and respectful person, with an open mind- yet she has the necessary boundaries that are required to organize an environment where so many different people are going to stay and hopefully enjoy. \nThe street itself is very lively, but the noises didn't bother me at all as i could easily block them out with earplugs. The location could not have been more sentral, still it's on \"the right side\" of the Rambla, where you can find more independent shops, restaurants, cafes and bars compared to the same leveled streets towards Raval. It is an old and very charming building, so if you want an minimalistic experience with cold, stainless steel and elevators this is not the place for you! And perhaps you are not the right person for this place either ;) I had to leave earlier due to illness, and was so sorry i couldn't stay throughout the whole month as planned. Hope to be seeing Isabel and her welcoming surroundings again one day "},{"at":"2016-09-07T04:00:00.000Z","by":{"_id":"6294d815d4a26c96b0b04788","fullname":"Jessy","imgUrl":"https://robohash.org/2935800?set=set1","id":"2935800"},"txt":"Isabel was an amazing host.

Being a citizen of the huge city too (Moscow, Russia) , underground is not our favorite place to be  :) \r\n\r\nOverall , it was a great stay. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"},{"at":"2013-11-01T04:00:00.000Z","by":{"_id":"6294d815d4a26c96b0b03ccb","fullname":"India","imgUrl":"https://robohash.org/228580?set=set1","id":"228580"},"txt":"Communication with Alex was spot on.

Extremely clean, and with all you could need for cooking.  The bed is so comfy.  The apartment is peaceful at night and I slept so well.   Some noise travels from Alex' apartment upstairs but it is only a little during the day.\r\nThe area is a bit out of the main hub of Williamsburg and Bushwick but everything is easily accessible with a short walk or the subway about 8 mins walk away.\r\nAlex left me a list of great stores, cafes and restaurants in the immediate area.  \r\nSome people may be concerned about the area at face value as it is a white minority but I felt safe at all times.  People seemed friendly.\r\n\r\n"},{"at":"2013-11-10T05:00:00.000Z","by":{"_id":"6294d815d4a26c96b0b04922","fullname":"Pamela","imgUrl":"https://robohash.org/8145538?set=set1","id":"8145538"},"txt":"Was an amazing stay, we charm your apartment and were very friendly.

She is respectful of one's privacy but always ready to give support when asked upon. Be it in spoken or written form I always got my answers from her within no times. She also proofed to be very flexible in terms of arrival and departure times which I appreciated a great deal. If you are a fan of jazz music (like I am), make sure to double check ahead of time about her current concert dates so as not to miss your hostess on stage like I did (grumble ;-)).\n\nThe room I occupied was the smaller one of two that Isabel rents out. So if her flat is fully rented out there can be a maximum of 4 guests plus your hostess in the flat, which can cause some bathroom jam, especially during the hot and humid summer times, when the need for a cool shower is inherent to everyone's desire. \nMy room was as depicted. If you plan on using it for double occupancy, I recommend taking Isa's larger room (unless the two of you are very much in love and want to cuddle up close ;-)). Also, if you need a table for writing, ask for the larger room as well, which comes along with one.\nThe flat itself is absolutely enchanting and furnished with love and an artistic eye to details. It's location is a dream for touristic explorations with anything within walking distance. \nTherefore, I can easily recommend both Isabel and her flat to anyone wishing to immerge himself into the local customs and get a good doze of what it is like \"to live like a true Barcelonian\".  \n\nQuerida Isa, muchas gracias por tu hospedalid génial!

It's a 20 minute walk from the beach which is a plus. It's located in a very old building on the top floor, so it is rather stuffy and warm in the apartment. The room overlooks a very narrow street/alley so it's rather dark and it's easy to hear the noise coming from the street and the neighboring apartments. There are a few other rooms in the house that are being rented out, so other people will be staying in the house which makes it a necessity to lock the room when you leave the apartment. \n\nIt's important to note that this place has a very strict check out time. On our last day, we had an evening flight but had to check out in the morning. When we asked if we could check out late, Isa told us to take our stuff to the train station and use the lockers there, but the train station does not have lockers. We ended up renting a locker  at a place called \"Barcelona lockers\". That, I would say changed all the plans for the last day. \n\n"},{"at":"2016-08-26T04:00:00.000Z","by":{"_id":"6294d815d4a26c96b0b04bdd","fullname":"Mina","imgUrl":"https://robohash.org/121053?set=set1","id":"121053"},"txt":"I was happy to experience Isabels home as described here. It was spacious, bright and original, with lovely colours and beautiful artwork surrounding me in every room. Isabel is a creative, sensitive and respectful person, with an open mind- yet she has the necessary boundaries that are required to organize an environment where so many different people are going to stay and hopefully enjoy. \nThe street itself is very lively, but the noises didn't bother me at all as i could easily block them out with earplugs. The location could not have been more sentral, still it's on \"the right side\" of the Rambla, where you can find more independent shops, restaurants, cafes and bars compared to the same leveled streets towards Raval. It is an old and very charming building, so if you want an minimalistic experience with cold, stainless steel and elevators this is not the place for you! And perhaps you are not the right person for this place either ;) I had to leave earlier due to illness, and was so sorry i couldn't stay throughout the whole month as planned.

She is respectful of one's privacy but always ready to give support when asked upon. Be it in spoken or written form I always got my answers from her within no times. She also proofed to be very flexible in terms of arrival and departure times which I appreciated a great deal. If you are a fan of jazz music (like I am), make sure to double check ahead of time about her current concert dates so as not to miss your hostess on stage like I did (grumble ;-)).\n\nThe room I occupied was the smaller one of two that Isabel rents out. So if her flat is fully rented out there can be a maximum of 4 guests plus your hostess in the flat, which can cause some bathroom jam, especially during the hot and humid summer times, when the need for a cool shower is inherent to everyone's desire. \nMy room was as depicted. If you plan on using it for double occupancy, I recommend taking Isa's larger room (unless the two of you are very much in love and want to cuddle up close ;-)). Also, if you need a table for writing, ask for the larger room as well, which comes along with one.\nThe flat itself is absolutely enchanting and furnished with love and an artistic eye to details. It's location is a dream for touristic explorations with anything within walking distance. \nTherefore, I can easily recommend both Isabel and her flat to anyone wishing to immerge himself into the local customs and get a good doze of what it is like \"to live like a true Barcelonian\".  \n\nQuerida Isa, muchas gracias por tu hospedalid génial!

It's a 20 minute walk from the beach which is a plus. It's located in a very old building on the top floor, so it is rather stuffy and warm in the apartment. The room overlooks a very narrow street/alley so it's rather dark and it's easy to hear the noise coming from the street and the neighboring apartments. There are a few other rooms in the house that are being rented out, so other people will be staying in the house which makes it a necessity to lock the room when you leave the apartment. \n\nIt's important to note that this place has a very strict check out time. On our last day, we had an evening flight but had to check out in the morning. When we asked if we could check out late, Isa told us to take our stuff to the train station and use the lockers there, but the train station does not have lockers. We ended up renting a locker  at a place called \"Barcelona lockers\". That, I would say changed all the plans for the last day. \n\n"},{"at":"2016-08-26T04:00:00.000Z","by":{"_id":"6294d815d4a26c96b0b04bdd","fullname":"Mina","imgUrl":"https://robohash.org/121053?set=set1","id":"121053"},"txt":"I was happy to experience Isabels home as described here. It was spacious, bright and original, with lovely colours and beautiful artwork surrounding me in every room. Isabel is a creative, sensitive and respectful person, with an open mind- yet she has the necessary boundaries that are required to organize an environment where so many different people are going to stay and hopefully enjoy. \nThe street itself is very lively, but the noises didn't bother me at all as i could easily block them out with earplugs. The location could not have been more sentral, still it's on \"the right side\" of the Rambla, where you can find more independent shops, restaurants, cafes and bars compared to the same leveled streets towards Raval. It is an old and very charming building, so if you want an minimalistic experience with cold, stainless steel and elevators this is not the place for you! And perhaps you are not the right person for this place either ;) I had to leave earlier due to illness, and was so sorry i couldn't stay throughout the whole month as planned.
